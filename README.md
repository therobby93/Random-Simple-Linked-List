Simple linked list
#Notes for me 
A linked list is a series of connected nodes, where each node is a data structure. The nodes of
a linked list are usually dynamically allocated, used, and then deleted, allowing the linked list
to grow or shrink in size as the program runs. If new information needs to be added to a
linked list, the program simply allocates another node and inserts it into the series. If a
particular piece of information needs to be removed from the linked list, the program deletes
the node containing that information.
